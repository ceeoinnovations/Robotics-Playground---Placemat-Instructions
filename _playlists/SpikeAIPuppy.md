: AI Lesson 1: Sit

description
: This lesson utilizes Nearest Centroid Classification to train the puppy to learn commands for sit and stand, based on how far your hand is from the distance sensor. Once trained, the puppy will be able to sit and stand based on your commands.

: AI Lesson 2: Pet the Puppy

description
: This lesson uses a 1-dimensional K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm to train the puppy to learn the difference between a “pat” and a “stroke”. Once trained, the puppy will react differently to a short press (pat) and a long press (stroke) of the force sensor.

: AI Lesson 3: Picky Eater

description
: This lesson also uses a KNN algorithm like lesson 2, but this time it is 3-dimensional, so it compares more values. Using this algorithm, the puppy can be trained to recognize “foods” of different colors and react accordingly. Once trained, the puppy will react positively to various shades of one color, and negatively to shades of a different color, depending on what it was trained with.

: AI Lesson 4: Fetch

description
: This lesson gives students the opportunity to implement one of two different algorithms: Linear Regression or Reinforcement Learning. Both approaches allow the puppy to be trained to determine how long to move forward, according to a desired distance. Once trained, the puppy will be given a distance value, either using the ultrasonic sensor or manual input, and can use the implemented algorithm and its training to determine how long it should move forward in order to reach the target distance.
