# Learning Goals

Engineering/Robotics Goals: 
- Use engineering thinking to come up with multiple solutions to the same problem
- Be able to understand basic coding frameworks
- Be able to think of and develop motor movement and motion mechanisms

Science Connections: 
- Identify what plants and animals exist in the ocean, jungle, and arctic.
- Identify how modes of transportation use the environment around them to get people from one place to another
- Understand traits of different biomes and how humans and animals interact with those traits.
