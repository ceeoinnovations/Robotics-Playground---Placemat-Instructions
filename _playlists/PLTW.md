description:  This playlist is based on the Project Lead the Way curriculum and will teach you about simple machines. A simple machine is a device that makes work easier by helping to move an object over a distance. Simple machines include levers, inclined planes, pulleys, wheels and axles, wedges, and screws. We’ll also learn about work, force, and energy.

title
: Build a Lever

description
: “A simple machine that moves a load around a fulcrum using a force.”
: Which of these “real-world things” is a lever?
: Can you think of some examples of real-world levers?
: Why are levers useful?
: What is the mechanical advantage of levers and what’s the physics behind how they work?
: Try moving the location of the fulcrum, how does it’s location affect how easy it is to lift the weight up and down?

: Pulley

description
: “A simple machine that uses grooved wheels and a rope to raise or lower a load.”
: Which of these “real-world things” is a pulley?
: Can you think of some examples of real-world pulleys?
: Why are pulleys useful?
: What is the mechanical advantage of pulleys and what’s the physics behind how they work?
: Compare how easy it is to lift an object with one pulley compared to two or three pulleys. Which reduces the amount of work you would have to do to lift an object (in which scenario do you have to apply left force to lift)?

: Pendulum

description
: “A weight hung from a fixed point so that it can swing freely backward and forward, especially a rod with a weight at the end.”
: Which of these “real-world things” is a pendulum?
: Can you think of some examples of real-world pendulum?
: Why are pendulums useful?
: What is the mechanical advantage of pendulums and what’s the physics behind how they work?
: Compare how fast the pendulum swings near the top versus near the bottom of the swing. Why do you think this is?

: Car Down a Ramp

description
: “A simple machine that is a sloping (or slanted) ramp that can be used to raise or lower a load by sliding. The slanted ramp helps to move things between lower and higher levels.”
: Which of these “real-world things” is an inclined plane?
: Can you think of some examples of real-world inclined planes?
: Why are inclined planes useful?
: What is the mechanical advantage of inclined planes and what’s the physics behind how they work?
: How does an inclined plane make the work of lifting the box easier?
